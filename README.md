This is a repository for the interactive demo I worked on for Dr. Koushik Kar of the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The research with which this demo is associated revolves around odor tracking in fruit flies. The demo is meant to place the user into the persective of a fruit fly trying to identify the location of a food source using only their sense of smell.
The demonstration was created using the Phaser library in JavaScript. It consists of a fly sprite that can be controlled by the user with a virtual joystick. The user must identify an invisible source of food using a ring around the fly sprite which indicates the intensity of the scent signal which the fly percieves at that location. The source code contains comments explain the function of each of the scene methods and the helper functions.
